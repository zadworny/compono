# Browsing Candidates

This is an example full-stack project in Docker Compose consisting of three services: `backend`, `api` and `app`. The `backend` is a mock of a legacy service that returns data of some job candidates. The `api` and `app` are a scaffolding of a web application with a PHP server (`api`) and a JavaScript frontend (`app`).

## Setup

To run the project you need Docker with Docker Compose installed.

To start the project run:

```
docker compose up
```

Then open the `http://localhost:8080/` URL in your browser.
